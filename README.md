# JavaScript Polar Chart EM Field Strength

![JavaScript Polar Chart EM Field Strength](polarEMFieldStrength.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example showcases a simple Polar Chart with two Area Series.

# PolarAreaSeries

*PolarAreaSeries* connects a list of *PolarPoints* with a stroke, and fills the enclosed area. 

[//]: # "IMPORTANT: The assets will not show before README.md is built - relative path is different!"

## Automatic closing of data points

By enabling automatic closing of data points
```typescript
PolarAreaSeries.setConnectDataAutomaticallyEnabled(true)
```
you can ensure that the highlighted area will be closed. In this picture there were only data points supplied for angles [0, 270], from there on, the data was automatically closed with a linear interpolation.
